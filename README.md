🌟 About Me

Hi! I’m Léon Habineza. I’m currently learning data engineering, analytics, and version control using Git and GitHub. My goal is to build practical skills by creating hands-on projects and documenting my learning process along the way.

I’m particularly interested in:

Working with structured data

Building clear and meaningful data models

Writing SQL for analysis and reporting

Understanding how data supports real decision-making

I’m still improving, but I enjoy learning step-by-step and sharing what I discover.
Feel free to connect or follow along as this project evolves.
